#Student Report System

I am creating a simple Student Report System, that will display students data after they have written their final exams
The system will be able to print from test marks, tutorial marks, project and the exam marks with grades respectively into their marks
This report will be able to print a report for an individual student and or the class report.
For the individual Student, we will be using the student_id to display the data.
For the class report, the program will be able to display the highest student, lowest student and average marks.
